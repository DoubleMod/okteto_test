# okteto_test
Okteto is a cloud-native development platform that provides a Kubernetes environment without the need for local installation, enabling developers to work remotely and test more efficiently. With Okteto, your code and dependencies can be automatically deployed on Kubernetes, along with a Web IDE for coding and debugging.

Some of the main features of Okteto include:

No local installation required: Okteto provides a cloud-based Kubernetes environment, eliminating the need to install and configure Kubernetes locally.
Live reload: Okteto can monitor changes to your code and automatically redeploy your application, without the need for manual service restarts.
Cloud IDE integration: Okteto integrates with VS Code and Web terminals, making it easy to code and debug in the cloud.
Image building: Okteto supports automatic container image builds and publishes them to Docker Hub and other container registries.
To use Okteto for development, you first create a Kubernetes namespace on Okteto and integrate it with your Git repository. Then, you can push your code to your Git repository, and Okteto will automatically pull the code and build the container image. Finally, you can use the Web terminal and IDE provided by Okteto to edit, test, and debug your code.

In summary, Okteto is a very convenient cloud-native development platform that greatly improves the efficiency of developers, without worrying about compatibility or configuration issues with local environments.
